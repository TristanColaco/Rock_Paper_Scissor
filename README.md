# **Rock Paper Scissors (RPS) Implementation**

A self-directed implementation of the classic game, developed independently without tutorial guidance.

The project demonstrates two distinct algorithmic approaches:

**Version 1:** Comprehensive conditional logic implementation

**Version 2:** Optimized solution using modulus arithmetic for win-condition determination

Both versions represent original problem-solving methodologies for game logic resolution.
